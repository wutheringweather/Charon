# install-community-skills.sh — OPTIONAL: refresh vendored skills from upstream
#
# Claude-BugHunter ships a frozen snapshot of shuvonsec's skills and
# commands inside skills/ and commands/. The default install path is
# install.sh — running this script is NOT required for first-time setup.
#
# Use this script only when you want to pull the LATEST upstream content
# (newer hunt-* patterns, updated VRT mappings, etc.) into your
# ~/.claude/. It clones shuvonsec/claude-bug-bounty into
# ~/security-research/community-skills/ and runs its installer.
#
# Note: this updates ~/.claude/ but does NOT update the bundled snapshot
# in this repo's skills/ — to refresh that, copy from ~/.claude/skills/
# back into the repo manually after running this.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run.
# Requires: git, bash.
