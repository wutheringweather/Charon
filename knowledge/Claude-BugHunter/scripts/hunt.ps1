# =====================================================================
# hunt — bug-bounty engagement scaffolding (Windows / PowerShell port)
#
# Native Windows port of scripts/hunt.sh. No WSL, no bash required.
# Adds a `hunt` function that creates a per-target working folder under
# $HOME\Targets\ with CLAUDE.md, scope.md, submissions tracker, findings
# folder, evidence folder (gitignored), and notes scratchpad.
#
# Usage:
#   hunt acme            # creates $HOME\Targets\acme\ with full template
#   hunt                 # shows usage
#
# Customize HUNT_BASE in your environment to override the parent dir:
#   $env:HUNT_BASE = "$HOME\security-research\Targets"
#
# Install: dot-source this file from your PowerShell profile ($PROFILE):
#   . "$HOME\.claude\scripts\hunt.ps1"

## Quick context for Claude

This folder is the working directory for a single bug-bounty engagement.
Files in this folder:

- `scope.md` — parsed scope, OOS list, focus areas, bounty bands
- `findings/` — one markdown file per finding draft (naming: `finding-<NN>-<short-name>.md`)
- `submissions.txt` — submission IDs tracker (used for chain cross-references)
- `evidence/` — screenshots, HARs, raw transcripts (gitignored — never share)
- `notes.md` — running notes, leads, dead ends, hypotheses

## Workflow

1. **Plan** — fill in `scope.md` from the program page. Use the `bb-methodology`
   and `osint-methodology` skills. Note Focus Areas and Bounty bands.

2. **Recon** — `offensive-osint`, `web2-recon`, and `bb-local-toolkit` for
   discovery. Pipe Burp through every browser session for proxy history.

3. **Hunt** — `web2-vuln-classes` (or per-class `hunt-*` skills if installed)
   plus `security-arsenal` for payloads.

4. **Validate** — run `/triage` on every lead BEFORE drafting a report.
   Apply the 7-Question Gate from `triage-validation`.

5. **Capture evidence** — `evidence-hygiene` BEFORE any screenshot.
   Cookies / PII / HARs all redacted per protocol.

6. **Report** — `report-writing` for the body template. `bugcrowd-reporting`
   if filing on Bugcrowd (VRT search, severity request, OOS rebuttals).

7. **Track** — append every submitted finding's UUID to `submissions.txt`
   so chained reports can cross-reference each other.

## Engagement-specific rules

- All testing on accounts I own.
- Stop immediately on encountering other-user PII; document and report.
- No public disclosure until program explicitly approves.
- Test-account email: `<your-bugcrowdninja-alias>@bugcrowdninja.com`
- Burp proxy capturing through all browser sessions for this target.

## Useful commands during the engagement

- `/scope <asset>` — verify a specific asset is in scope
- `/triage` — quick 7-Question Gate on a finding
- `/validate` — full 4-gate finding validator
- `/report` — draft a submission-ready report
- `/remember` — log a finding to hunt memory

> Parse this from the program page (Bugcrowd / HackerOne / etc.) before
> doing any active testing. `/scope <asset>` can verify individual assets.

## In scope

- (paste in-scope asset list here)

## Out of scope

- (paste OOS list here, including any bug classes excluded by the program)

## Focus areas

- (paste Focus Areas / accepted impacts list — these are the highest-leverage targets)

## Bounty bands

| Severity | Band |
|---|---|
| P1 (Critical) | |
| P2 (High) | |
| P3 (Medium) | |
| P4 (Low) | |
| P5 (Info) | (often unrewarded) |

## Engagement rules / safe harbor

- (paste any researcher-conduct rules — testing-account requirements,
  rate-limit caps, no-DoS clauses, KYC posture, contact email, etc.)

## Account / testing setup

- **Test account email:** (`alias@bugcrowdninja.com` if Bugcrowd)
- **Test account uid:**
- **Production vs QA:** (which environment is in scope, and any special access notes)
- **Mobile builds:** (Android APK / iOS IPA download URLs if provided)
- **Authentication notes:** (SSO, MFA enrollment status, etc.)

## OOS clauses worth pre-empting in submissions

> Note any OOS clauses that might be miscategorized against your findings.
> Use this to draft `In-scope justification` paragraphs proactively.

- (e.g., "Rate limiting on non-authentication endpoints" — applies to
  non-auth endpoints only; verify_password / OTP / token-validate are auth)
- (e.g., "User Enumeration with low-risk info" — applies only when info
  enumerated is low-risk; real-name PII is NOT low-risk)

#
# Format (tab-separated):

One markdown file per lead.

## Naming

`finding-<NN>-<short-name>.md`

Examples:
- `finding-01-graphql-apq-bypass.md`
- `finding-02-verify-password-no-rate-limit.md`
- `finding-03-update-password-no-stepup.md`

## Per-finding template

Each finding file should have:
1. Status (lead / validated / drafted / submitted / triaged / paid / closed)
2. The finding summary (use `triage-validation`'s 7-Question Gate format)
3. Reproduction steps with exact requests/responses
4. Evidence inventory (path to redacted screenshots in ../evidence/)
5. Severity reasoning + VRT mapping (if Bugcrowd)
6. Submission UUID (once filed)
7. Triager dialogue / status updates
